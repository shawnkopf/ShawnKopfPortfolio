# Basic Cryptocurrency Project

This project is a simplified blockchain-based cryptocurrency system designed to demonstrate the core concepts of cryptocurrencies, including blockchain technology, consensus algorithms, digital wallets, and peer-to-peer (P2P) networking. It's built using TypeScript/JavaScript for the blockchain logic, PHP for server-side scripting (if applicable), HTML/CSS for the frontend, and SQLite for database management (if needed).

## Features

- **Blockchain Implementation**: A simple blockchain structure to store transactions.
- **Proof of Work**: A basic proof-of-work algorithm to validate new blocks.
- **Digital Wallet**: Functionality for users to manage their cryptocurrency.
- **P2P Network**: A basic peer-to-peer network for node communication.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed (for running TypeScript and the P2P network)
- A modern web browser to view the frontend
- (Optional) PHP server setup if PHP scripts are used
