# Basic Cryptocurrency Project

This project is a simplified blockchain-based cryptocurrency system designed to demonstrate the core concepts of cryptocurrencies, including blockchain technology, consensus algorithms, digital wallets, and peer-to-peer (P2P) networking. It's built using TypeScript/JavaScript for the blockchain logic, PHP for server-side scripting (if applicable), HTML/CSS for the frontend, and SQLite for database management (if needed).

## Features

- **Blockchain Implementation**: A simple blockchain structure to store transactions.
- **Proof of Work**: A basic proof-of-work algorithm to validate new blocks.
- **Digital Wallet**: Functionality for users to manage their cryptocurrency.
- **P2P Network**: A basic peer-to-peer network for node communication.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed (for running TypeScript and the P2P network)
- A modern web browser to view the frontend
- (Optional) PHP server setup if PHP scripts are used

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourrepository/cryptocurrency.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd cryptocurrency

3. Install the necessary Node.js dependencies (if any):
npm install

4. Compile TypeScript files to JavaScript:
tsc

Running the Project
Open index.html in your web browser to interact with the cryptocurrency system.
If your project includes server-side components, ensure your PHP server is running and configured to serve the project directory.
Usage
View Blockchain: The blockchain can be viewed in the frontend UI, displaying all blocks and transactions.
Create Transactions: Users can create transactions through the digital wallet interface.
Mine Blocks: New blocks can be mined, adding pending transactions to the blockchain.
P2P Network: Nodes can connect to each other to synchronize the blockchain state across the network.
